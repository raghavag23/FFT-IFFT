# FFT-IFFT
 Developed an FFT/IFFT module in Verilog for signal processing applications, handling discrete signals of 8, 16, or 32 points
 Designed a memory module to store input signals and write computed outputs back, ensuring efficient read/write operations
 Implemented a control unit for managing data flow and operations between the memory and FFT/IFFT computation modules
